Protecting the atmospheric environment requires both effective control of emissions and a deep understanding of pollutant behavior in the air. AirQuality Monitoring Networks, powered by APIsand real-time sensors, are designed to monitor the concentration of pollutants such as particulatematter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere. These networks aim to define air quality levels, ensure compliance with air protection legislation, and trigger action plans when contamination exceeds safe thresholds.In addition to providing crucial data for regulatory compliance, these monitoring systems helpidentify pollution hotspots, track changes over time, and provide valuable insights for the development of pollution mitigation strategies. Furthermore, they play a key role in publicawareness by delivering real-time air quality information to citizens, enabling informed decisionsregarding health and safety. This project explores the role of Air Quality Monitoring APIs inenvironmental protection, emphasizing their importance in managing air pollution and maintaining atmospheric health in line with Indian and international standards.
